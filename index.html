The youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill, The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case, These were dispatched with bayonets or battered with the blunts of muskets; . . . . A call in the midst of the crowd, The pedlar sweats with his pack on his back—the purchaser higgles about the odd cent.

I dote on myself…there is that lot of me, and all so luscious, A word of reality…materialism first and last imbueing. Workmen searching after damages and to make indispensible repairs, To niches aside and junior bending. I effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags..

			 The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or the motion of waves a key, And the night is for you and me and all, The sentries desert every other part of me.

And mine a word of the modern…a word en masse. The ring of alarm-bells…the cry of fire…the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and colored lights, But they are not the Me myself. If I worship any particular thing it shall be some of the spread of my body; Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou.

Who has done his day's work and will soonest be through with his supper? Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the moccasin print; Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, Where the life-car is drawn on the slipnoose…where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand, My brain it shall be your occult convolutions.

And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps. Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides, And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statue, Where the laughing-gull scoots by the slappy shore and laughs her near-human laugh.

One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself, Ever the eaters and drinkers…ever the upward and downward sun…ever the air and the ceaseless tides, I go hunting polar furs and the seal…leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff…clinging to topples of brittle and blue. Our swift ordinances are on their way over the whole earth, The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon.
